# 1. Problem Definition

**Difficulty:** `Medium`

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

# 2. Approach

It is a very simple problem where you need to keep attending characters in a temporary string until you find a space and then append this temporary string to a list and empty the temporary string.

Reverse the list and convert to a sentence and return.

# 3. Pseudo Code

### 3.0.1. Traditional Way

```
words = []
temp = ''

FOR ch in s
    IF ch != ' ' then
        temp += ch
    ELSE IF temp is not empty then
        words.append(temp)
        temp = ''

IF temp is not empty then
    words.append(temp)

words = reverse of words
return JOIN words with spaces
```

### 3.0.2. Python Functions

```
s = s.split()
s = reverse of s
return JOIN s with spaces
```

# 4. Code

**Time Complexity:** O(N)

**Space Complexity:** O(N)

```python
def reverse_words(s: str) -> str:
    s = s.split()
    return ' '.join(s[:: -1])
```
